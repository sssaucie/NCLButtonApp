# PhunApp
 Interview App for Phunware
##  Code Quality Check
- [ ] File and var permissions - are final, private, public, etc marked correctly?
- [ ] Is it threaded correctly?
- [ ] Are the tests thorough? UI and unit
- [ ] Documentation?
- [ ] Organization?
- [ ] Test on phones, tablets, and different orientations?
- [ ] Write PR notes on what, why, how
- [ ] Delete any debugging print statements
- [ ] handle any TODOs, FIXMEs, and warnings
- [ ] check for any leftover force unwraps

## Assumptions
- This app is for the purpose of assessing individual skill, and is not expected to 
  be fully complete and publish-ready within the timeframe specified 
  in challenge requirements.
- This app is to be considered a first rough draft prototype and not a final project.
- NCL understands the programmer is motivated to learn and progress, with a team
  to help facilitate understanding and aptitude.
  
## Proposed Improvements
- Testing capabilities
- Accessibility
- Custom error handling
- Custom logging
- Custom UI components (eg, custom buttons)
- LTR capability

## Other Notes
***IMPORTANT***
- I will generally use a Room Database and DAO for parsing JSON data to store it locally; 
  however, because it was not listed as a requirement for the project, I took the easy 
  (lazy) route.
- Navigation components are created for future capability and functionality in addition to
  current navigation.
- Thank you for the opportunity to build this app for you! I'm excited to talk this
  over with you, and I acknowledge that this first draft is only a rough draft.
